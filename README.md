# GRCToolKit
This web application provides a user interface for interacting with a simulated AI GRC agent. When you enter a scenario and click "Analyze Scenario," it will send your prompt to the gemini-2.0-flash model, which is instructed to act as a GRC expert and return relevant NIST 800-53 R.5 controls.

Key Features of the Provided Code:

1. Responsive Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a clean, mobile-first, and responsive layout.

1. User Input: A textarea for users to describe their GRC scenario.

1. AI Integration (Simulated): Makes a fetch call to the Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash) to get a response, simulating the AI agent's core logic.

Loading Indicator: A simple spinner and text change to indicate when the AI is processing.

1. Error Handling: Basic error display for API call failures or unexpected responses.

1. NIST 800-53 Focus: The prompt specifically guides the AI to focus on NIST 800-53 R.5 controls.

Next Steps & Potential Enhancements:

Refine AI Prompting: Experiment with more detailed prompts to get more precise and structured responses from the AI, potentially including specific CSF 2.0 mappings.

Structured Output: Modify the generationConfig to request a JSON schema for the AI's response (e.g., an array of objects, each containing a control ID, name, and explanation). This would make parsing and displaying the results much easier and more consistent.

Actual GRC Data Integration: For a real grctoolkit.ai, you would need to ingest the actual NIST 800-53 and CSF 2.0 data into a database (like Firestore) and use a more sophisticated backend to perform the control mapping and reasoning, rather than relying solely on the LLM for direct recall.

User Authentication & Data Persistence: Integrate Firebase Authentication to manage users and Firestore to save user queries, generated reports, or custom GRC data.

Advanced UI: Add features like filtering controls, linking to official NIST documentation, and allowing users to mark controls as implemented.

Backend AI Logic: Develop a dedicated backend service to host more complex AI models (e.g., fine-tuned models for GRC, knowledge graphs) and integrate with other GRC tools.
