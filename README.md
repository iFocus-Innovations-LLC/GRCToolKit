# GRCToolKit
This web application provides a user interface for interacting with a simulated AI GRC agent. When you enter a scenario and click "Analyze Scenario," it will send your prompt to the gemini-2.0-flash model, which is instructed to act as a GRC expert and return relevant NIST 800-53 R.5 controls.
